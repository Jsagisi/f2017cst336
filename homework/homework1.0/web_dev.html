               Web developers create websites and are responsible for the look of the site. They are also in charge of technical parts of the website such as the performance the website can handle as well as the capacity it can contain, traffic.  Their main job is to try to capture exactly what their customers want on their website.  They have to understand what resources they need for example a company may need a payment-processing application whilst the another company may need more advanced graphics to run a game.  More specifically, a backend web developer works on the technical construction of the site such as the framework allowing everything to run together smoothly.  Front end web developers work on the looks such as the layout, integrated graphics, as well as apps.  They can also write web-design programs written in HTML or Javascript.
